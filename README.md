## Project Description

### Problem
How can we cultivate more dialogue between undergraduates and professors and PhD students? How can we help undergraduates have a more seamless experience looking for assistantships/research experiences? 

### Solution
A platform to connect undergraduates with research assistantships and opportunities to work closely with professors/PhDs.  This will provide an arena for student-professor dialogue where students can search for opportunities and professors can post if they’re looking for students or open to being contacted by students.


### Key Features
- Posts and listings: Professors and graduate students post and update listings regarding their research needs students can search and filter through 
- Profiles: Professors/grad students can showcase past research and list whether they are generally open to student contact, students can list their research interests and academic background 
- Recommended opportunities: Matches students with opportunities similar to their interests, keyword matching 
- Suggested reading: Ability to read research papers, recommended daily reading

### Why this project?
As undergraduates, the idea of research is appealing but the cold-emailing can be daunting. How can we mitigate this issue using what we know? While many might find email rejections or ghosting a rite of passage in academia, we believe that opportunities will increase by creating space for professors and students to set expectations. Research assistantships are a great way to gain hands-on experience or learn more in-depth about a topic of interest, but how many of those opportunities are unknown to us? UMass is a big campus and a one-stop-shop to introduce all eager participants might just be another way to strengthen community and flow of ideas.
